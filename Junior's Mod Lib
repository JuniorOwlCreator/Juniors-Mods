Name: Junior's Mod Library
Mod Locations:
Modrinth - 
Curseforge - 

Description:
This mod adds nothing visual to the game as it is a library mod. This mod only serves as a base for the other mods. Visit the Curseforge or Modrinth page to see all the official mods (Made by me) that require
this mod. To see more about the project in general. For a more in-depth and technical side of what this library mod includes, go to the "Technical" heading below. These files will not include much more than a
table of contents and some other details to keep them short and easy. You will also be able to open a file called tutorial that will include a tutorial of each mod and how to install each one.

Technical:
This mod library adds the starter code for items, creative tabs, blocks and even more. This makes it easier to make blocks while Im coding. If you have had any experience with library mods, you will understand.
This really isnt useful or made for the general public.
